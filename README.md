I thank the people who did this incredible job.
I recommend you to follow the users, they have good projects in their accounts:
* [ReiDoBregaBR](https://github.com/ReiDoBrega) Design the script with a new layout 
* [Puyodead1](https://github.com/Puyodead1) Original base script

## If you're wondering why I just posted it publicly, it's because this was leaked to a lot of people when it was posted in the discord group anyway
(Anyway this was an open project kek)

I know it has nothing to do with what I said above but fuck WVLeaks
